              <h6>Methodology:</h6>
              <p>The website promotes the ‘aqeedah (beliefs) of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah and the followers of the righteous early generations of Islam (as-salaf as-saalih). It strives to ensure that the answers are based on evidence from the Holy Qur’an and the soundly-narrated (saheeh) prophetic Sunnah, and are taken from the writings of the scholars, including the imams of the four madhhabs, Imam Abu Haneefah, Imam Maalik, Imam ash-Shaafa‘i and Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, as well as other earlier and later scholars, and from the statements of fiqh councils and seekers of knowledge who  conduct research in various Islamic specialties.</p>
              <p>The website avoids getting involved in issues that are of no benefit, such as empty arguments, trading insults and fruitless debates.</p>
              <p>O Allah, we ask You to make us steadfast in adhering to the path of guidance, and to help us to do that which You love and are pleased with. Ameen.</p>
