           <h3>Introduction</h3>
     	   
           <p>In the Name of Allaah, the All-Merciful, the Ever Merciful, may He raise the rank of His last Prophet and Messenger, Muhammad, and that of his family and comp anions, and may He grant them all an abundance of peace. Verily, Allaah is Generous and Merciful.</p>
                
            <p>This article will hopefully (if Allaah wills) explain the legislated times of the five daily prayers, such as when they are, with a brief reference to the relative proofs (the Qur'an and the Sunnah, that is).

            <h3>The Legislated Times for the Five Daily Prayers</h3>
                
    <p>The Muslims have never differed over the fact that the five daily prayers have specific times that have been legislated in the Sharee’ah. Allaah, the Almighty, has said, “Verily, prayers have been prescribed upon the believers at set times.”</p>
            
    <p id="evidence">Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:<br />

<br />The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said: Gabriel (Peace be upon him) led me in prayer at the House (i.e. the Ka'bah). He prayed the noon prayer with me when the sun had passed the meridian to the extent of the thong of a sandal; he prayed the afternoon prayer with me when the shadow of everything was as long as itself; he prayed the sunset prayer with me when one who is fasting breaks the fast; he prayed the night prayer with me when the twilight had ended; and he prayed the dawn prayer with me when food and drink become forbidden to one who is keeping the fast.
<br />
On the following day he prayed the noon prayer with me when his shadow was as long as himself; he prayed the afternoon prayer with me when his shadow was twice as long as himself; he prayed the sunset prayer at the time when one who is fasting breaks the fast; he prayed the night prayer with me when about the third of the night had passed; and he prayed the dawn prayer with me when there was a fair amount of light.
<br />
Then turning to me he said: Muhammad, this is the time observed by the prophets before you, and the time is anywhere between two times.<br />
[Ahmed 3081, Abu Dawud 393]</p>

<p>The following is a listing of the times of the five daily prayers, with a brief reference to their relative proofs from the Book and the Sunnah:</p>

<br />
<h4>1 - The time of Thuhr (Noon) Prayer</h4>
<p>The time of Thuhr (Noon) Prayer begins just after the sun's zenith (or "high noon"), as soon as it begins to decline, as the scholars unanimously agreed. Its time extends until the entrance of the 'Asr Prayer, according to the hadeeth, "The (time of) Thuhr is when the sun has begun to decline, until one’s shadow is as long as his height, until the entrance of ‘Asr time.”</p>
<p>Knowing the time of the zenith by the clock: divide the time between sunrise and sunset in half, and that is the time of the zenith. If we assume that the sun rises at 6 a.m. and sets at 6 p.m., then the zenith is at 12 noon. If it rises at 7 a.m. and sets at 7 p.m., then the zenith is at 1 p.m., and so on.</p>
<p>See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/96 </p>
<h4>2 - The time of Asr (Afternoon) Prayer</h4>
<p>As mentioned clearly in the previous hadeeth, the time of ‘Asr Prayer begins at a mid-way point between Thuhr and Maghrib, when a person’s shadow is as long as his height.   The time of ‘Asr extends until sunset.  The Prophet (may Allaah raise his rank and grant him peace) said, “Whoever has prayed one rak’ah (unit) of the ‘Asr Prayer before sunset has caught the (time of) ‘Asr.”</p>

<p>The Hanifis say in regards to the Asr Prayer that it is when the shadow of one becomes twice the size of ones body shape. And their evidence is from the Hadith mentioned above, ' ...Then we offered the Asr when the shadow of everything was twice as long.' [Ahmed 3081, Abu Dawud 393]<br />
In general the meaning to their opinion is that they pray roughly one hour after the Adhan Al-Asr...</p>

<h4>3 - The time of Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer</h4>

<p>The time of Maghrib begins after the sun has completely set, according to scholarly consensus. Its time extends until the enterance of 'Eesha' Prayer. The Prophet (may Allaah raise his rank and grant him peace) said, "And the time of Maghrib Prayer extends so long as there is some glow left on the (Western) horizon." This period of time is usually a little over an hour in most places.<br>
In addition, the beginning time of Maghrib marks a new day in the Islaamic calendar.</p>

<h4>4 - The time of 'Eesha' (Evening) Prayer</h4>

<p>The time of 'Eesha' begins after the last glow of the sun has left the Western horizon. Its time extends until half of the night. The Prophet (may Allaah raise his rank and grant him peace) said, "And the (time of) 'Eesha' extends to half the night."</p>

<p>Question: How do we calculate when midnight is?</p>

<p>Answer: If you want to calculate when midnight is, then calculate the time between sunset and the break of true dawn (when Fajr begins) then divide it in half; that halfway point is the end of the time for praying ‘Isha’ (and that is midnight).</p>

<p>So if the sun sets at 5 p.m., and Fajr begins at 5 a.m., then midnight is 11 p.m. If the sun sets at 5 p.m. and Fajr begins at 6 a.m., then midnight is 11.30 p.m., and so on.</p>

<h4>5 - The time of Fajr (Dawn) or Subh Prayer</h4>

<p>The Fajr or Subh Prayer begins at the first light of the dawn of the sun, the first glow on the Eastern horizon where the sun will rise from. This is understood from the Verse, "Until the white thread (of the dawn) becomes distinguishable from the black thread." It extends until the sun begins to rise, according to this hadeeth, "And the (time of) Subh Prayer is from the first light of dawn until sunrise." This period of time is usually a little over an hour in most places.</p>

<p>The time for Fajr begins with the onset of the “second dawn” (al-fajr al-thaani) and ends when the sun starts to rise. The “second dawn” is the brightness that appears along the horizon in the east and extends north to south. The “first dawn” (al-fajr al-awwal) occurs approximately one hour before this, and there are differences between the two:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the “first dawn” the brightness extends from east to west, and in the “second dawn” it extends from north to south.</li>
    <br />
    <li>The “first dawn” is followed by darkness, i.e., the brightness lasts for a short period then it becomes dark. The “second dawn” is not followed by darkness, rather the light increases.</li>
    <br />
    <li>The “second dawn” is connected to the horizon, with no darkness between it and the horizon, whereas the “first dawn” is separated from the horizon with darkness between it and the horizon.</li>
</ol>

<p>See al-Sharsh al-Mumti', 2/107.</p>
     	
<p>The Hanafis differed from the majority in reference with the Fajr Prayer, and they referred this to the part of the Hadith that is mentioned above, '...and Fajr when the earth was well-lit.' [Ahmed 3081, Abu Dawud 393]</p>
<p>This is meant by 'the earth was well-lit' is towards the ending of Fajr just a little bit before the time of Sharook (Sunrise) where most of the sun light starts to show. Undoubtedly Abu Hanifa has based his opinion on an authentic Hadith, but the majority such as Malik and As-Shaaf'ie and Ahmad choose the first timings of the Prayer that was revealed to the the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by Jibril (as mentioned above). The opinion of the majority is more revised because this assures that one prays on time without the worry of the Prayer over lapsing its prescribed time.</p>

     	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>These are the times of the five daily prayers in Islaam, as Jibreel (peace be upon him) taught Muhammad (may Allaah raise his rank and grant him peace). The times of the prayers are all based on the positions of the sun, in a way that makes it easy for the majority of the people on earth to know them without any difficulty whatsoever.</p>

<p>As stated by the Permanent Committee of Scholars for Research and Fatwaa: “The easy way that is in line with the fitrah (the natural state things are created upon) is to rely on the indications in nature (the positions of the sun) that have been indicated in the Islaamic Legislation to determine the times of the prayers.”</p>

<p>And Allah knows best...</p>
